Data Cleaning Notes for the DUNEX data set

General Data cleaning process
Apply overall spatial mask to cut the cross-shore location at the most offshore land point based on bathymetry and water level.

Mission 1(Cleaned on 02/24/22): Adjusted the end time from 2021-10-04T15:30:00 to 2021-10-04T15:17:00 since the microSWIFTs started being picked up at this point

Mission 2(Cleaned on 02/24/22): Adjusted start time from 2021-10-05T14:30:00 to 2021-10-05T14:41:00 since the microSWIFTs were still on surfboards until this point.
				Adjusted end time from 2021-10-05T16:00:00 to 2021-10-05T14:50:00 since all of the microSWIFTs have reached the beach at this point. 
				Masked microSWIFT 4 from the start to index 200 since it was still on a surfboard as seen by smaller signals then a large spike in acceleration as it is thrown in.
				Masked microSWIFT 5 from the start to index 200 since it was still on a surfboard as seen by smaller signals then a large spike in acceleration as it is thrown in.
				Masked microSWIFT 3 from the start to index 200 since it was still on a surfboard as seen by smaller signals then a large spike in acceleration as it is thrown in.
			      
Mission 3(Cleaned on 02/24/22): Adjusted start time from 2021-10-05T17:10:00 to 2021-10-05T17:17:00 since the microSWIFTs were still on the surfboards at this point as seen by fast offshore movement.
                                Adjusted end time from 2021-10-05T17:40:00 to 2021-10-05T17:37:00 since all of the microSWIFTs had reached the beach at this point.
                                Masked microSWIFT 40 from index 7000 to the end since it reached the beach and a few points were not masked as it maybe moved back offshore briefly after passing the spatial threshold
                                Masked microSWIFT 3 from index 9000 to the end since it reached the beach and a few points were not masked as it maybe moved back offshore briefly after passing the spatial threshold
                                Masked microSWIFT 39 from index 4500 to the end since it reached the beach and a few points were not masked as it maybe moved back offshore briefly after passing the spatial threshold
                                Masked microSWIFT 41 from index 8500 to the end since it reached the beach and a few points were not masked as it maybe moved back offshore briefly after passing the spatial threshold

Mission 4(Cleaned on 02/25/22): Adjusted start time from 2021-10-05T18:06:00 to 2021-10-05T18:13:00 since the microSWIFTs were still on the surfboards as seen by them moving quickly offshore before deployment
                                Adjusted end time from 2021-10-05T18:35:00 to 2021-10-05T18:24:00 since all of the microSWIFTs had based the beach spatial mask at this point.
                                Masked microSWIFT 40 from index 6800 to the end since it passed the spatial threshold but moved back out briefly.
                                Masked microSWIFT 40 from index 6500 to the end since it passed the spatial threshold but moved back out briefly.
                                Masked microSWIFT 40 from index 7000 to the end since it passed the spatial threshold but moved back out briefly.

Mission 5(Cleaned on 03/01/22): Adjusted the start time from 2021-10-05T18:35:00 to 2021-10-05T18:40:00 since the microSWIFTs were still on the surfboard at this point 
                                Masked microSWIFT 3 from the start to index 1500 since the IMU was not recording correctly at this point as seen by a nonfluctuating acceleration signal
                                Masked microSWIFT 42 from the start to index 500 since it had a large spike in acceleration most likely due to being thrown 
                                Masked microSWIFT 39 from the start to index 500 since it had a large spike in acceleration most likely due to being thrown 
                                Masked microSWIFT 5 from the start to index 1000 since it had a large spike in acceleration most likely due to being thrown into the water
                                Masked microSWIFT 38 from the start to index 1500 since the IMU was not recording correctly at this point as seen by a nonfluctuating acceleration signal
                                Removed microSWIFT 40 since it had unreasonably high sea surface elevations (~ 5 meters) most likely due to a short record(~2500 points)
                                Removed microSWIFT 41 since it had unreasonably high sea surface elevations (~ 5 meters) most likely due to a short record(~2500 points)
                                Removed microSWIFT 57 since it had a huge spike in acceleration and value of sea surface elevation of ~300 meters due to potentially a malfunction in the accelerometer or gyroscope 

Mission 6(Cleaned on 02/25/22): Not a separate mission from mission 1 but these are the microSWIFTs that drifted super far north - removed from the cleaned dataset since it is not useful data for this project - all buoys are far from the test site and in deep/
			       intermediate water

Mission 7(Cleaned on 02/25/22): Masked microSWIFT 40 from index 36000 to the end since it reached the beach in the send window so we are masking from the start of the send window to the end
                                Masked microSWIFT 40 from index 36000 to the end since it reached the beach in the send window so we are masking from the start of the send window to the end
                                Masked microSWIFT 40 from index 36000 to the end since it reached the beach in the send window so we are masking from the start of the send window to the end
                                (11/13/22)Removed Mission 7 due to too many non-physically large spikes in accelerations, velocities, and sea surface elevation

Mission 8(Cleaned on 02/25/22): Adjusted start time from 2021-10-07T14:00:00 to 2021-10-07T14:02:00 since a few of the microSWIFTs were still on the pier at this point as seen by flat acceleration signals
                                Adjusted end time from 2021-10-07T14:20:00 to 2021-10-07T14:16:00 since all of the microSWIFTs had reached the beach at this point.

Mission 9(Cleaned on 02/25/22): Only two microSWIFTs went out - this is a small mission - not sure why the location of one of the microSWIFTs cuts out before the beach, must have lost GPS signal
                                Adjusted the end time from 2021-10-07T14:50:00 to 2021-10-07T14:40:00 since both microSWIFTs had reached the beach at this point

Mission 10(Cleaned on 01/26/22): Moved start time from 2021-10-07T14:40:00 to 2021-10-07T14:46:15 since the microSWIFTs were still on the jetski until then as seen from visual inspection from plotting with the original dataset. 

Mission 11(Cleaned on 01/26/22): Adjusted start time from 2021-10-07T15:10:00 to 2021-10-07T15:12:00 since the microSWIFTs are still moving offshore on the jetski prior to deployment.
                                 Adjusted end time from 2021-10-07T16:00:00 to 2021-10-07T15:21:00 since almost every microSWIFT hit the beach before this except for microSWIFT 34.
                                 Deleted microSWIFT 41 from the dataset since it is missing almost all GPS data and therefore we can't use it.
                                 microSWIFT 34 was still on the jetski and was not deployed until about 2.7 minutes (index 2000) after the other so it is individually being masked from the beginning

Mission 12(Cleaned on 01/26/22): Adjusted start time from 2021-10-07T16:00:00 to 2021-10-07T16:05:30 since the microSWIFTs do not have a wave signal until this index (mostly flat signal)
                                 Adjusted end time from 2021-10-07T16:30:00 to 2021-10-07T16:21:00 since all microSWIFTs have reached the beach by this point.
                                 microSWIFT 57 has one spot at the end of the time series that isn't getting masked after index 10000 so we will manually mask it

Mission 13(Cleaned on 01/26/22): Adjusted start time from 2021-10-07T17:00:00 to 2021-10-07T17:02:45 since the microSWIFTs were all still stationary on the pier until this time.
                                 Adjusted end time from 2021-10-07T17:25:00 to 2021-10-07T17:23:00 since all of the microSWIFTs had reached the beach before this point.

Mission 14(Cleaned on 01/26/22): Adjusted start time from 2021-10-07T18:00:00 to 2021-10-07T18:01:00 since the first few data points of a couple show a signal that is not quite in the water since it is a mostly flat signal.
                                 Adjusted end time from 2021-10-07T18:35:00 to 2021-10-07T18:15:30 since almost every microSWIFT reached the beach before this time and the few that did not were caught in a swash zone eddy so the data is not useful for this project.
                                 Note that microSWIFT 38's magnetometer was not working so it recorded all zeros in all directions
                                 (11/13/22) Removed microSWIFT 42 due to large spikes in accelerations, velocities, and positions

Mission 15(Cleaned on 01/26/22): Adjusted end time from 2021-10-08T13:46:00 to 2021-10-08T13:38:00 since almost all microSWIFTs reached the beach before that time.
                                 (11/13/22) Removed microSWIFTs 46, 39, 38, 16, and 29 from the dataset due to large spikes and nonphysical signals
                                 microSWIFT 14 was masked from index 14000 to the end since it had reached the beach and rolled back out.

Mission 16(Cleaned on 01/26/22): Adjusted the start time from 2021-10-08T14:05:00 to 2021-10-08T14:10:30 since most of the microSWIFTs were not in the water at this point as seen by a mostly flat signal in all IMU measurements.
                                 Adjusted the end time from 2021-10-08T14:46:00 to 2021-10-08T14:32:00 since all of the microSWIFTs had made it to the beach at this point.
                                 Removed microSWIFT 41 since it has only a very small amount of data mostly before any of the others were deployed
                                 Removed microSWIFT 37 since it has only a very small amount of data mostly before any of the others were deployed
                                 Removed microSWIFT 44 since it has only a very small amount of data mostly before any of the others were deployed
                                 Removed microSWIFT 43 since it has only a very small amount of data mostly before any of the others were deployed
                                 Removed microSWIFT 16 since it has only a very small amount of data mostly before any of the others were deployed
                                 Removed microSWIFT 42 since it has only a very small amount of data mostly before any of the others were deployed
                                 Removed microSWIFT 34 since it has only a very small amount of data mostly before any of the others were deployed
                                 Removed microSWIFT 33 since it has only a very small amount of data mostly before any of the others were deployed
                                 (11/13/22) Removed microSWIFT 11 due to large spikes and nonphysical signals
                                 microSWIFT 38 is masked from index 7000 to the end since it has large spikes that are non-physical.
                                 
Mission 17(Cleaned on 01/26/22): Adjusted start time from 2021-10-08T15:00:00 to 2021-10-08T15:04:30 since most of the microSWIFTs are still on the jetski at this point as we can see non-wave looking IMU signal.
                                 Adjusted end time from 2021-10-08T16:00:00 to 2021-10-08T15:25:00 since most of the microSWIFTs reached the beach by this point.
                                 Removed microSWIFT 46 since it is missing all x_FRF values meaning it did not have good GPS data.
                                 Removed microSWIFTs 13, 22, 41, 12, 21, 11, 42, 34, and 33 since they were all deployed before the further offshore one and made it to the beach before each other microSWIFT was deployed. 
                                 microSWIFT 44 is masked from index 9000 to the end since it has no real-looking signals from the IMU which indicates it is most likely on the beach.
                                 (11/13/22) Masked microSWIFT 17 from start to index 2000, microSWIFT 18 from start to 1000, and removed microSWIFT 16 due to nonphysical signals

Mission 18(Cleaned on 01/26/22): Adjusted start time from 2021-10-08T17:00:00 to 2021-10-08T17:04:30 since most of the microSWIFTs were still on the jetski at this point in time. 
                                 Adjusted end time from 2021-10-08T18:00:00 to 2021-10-08T17:42:00 since all of the microSWIFTs have reached the beach at this point.
                                 microSWIFT 12 is masked from index 20000 to the end since it has reached the beach and potentially rolled back down briefly. 
                                 (11/13/22) Removed microSWIFTs 46, 41, 37, 44, 43, 16, 42, 34, and 33 then masked 5 from 0 to index 1000 all due to non-physical spikes in the data
                                 microSWIFT_29 was masked from the start to index 1000 since there is a massive sea surface elevation spike that is not even remotely physical.

Mission 19(Cleaned on 01/26/22): Adjusted end time from 2021-10-08T19:00:00 to 2021-10-08T18:46:00 since all the microSWIFTs made it to the beach before this time.
                                 microSWIFT 42 is missing the magnetometer measurements and all measurements are zeros
                                 (11/12/22) Removed microSWIFTs 46, 41, 37, 44, 43, 16, 42, and 56 the masked 29 from start to index 1000 due to nonphysical signals
                                 microSWIFT_29 was masked from the start to index 1000 since there is a massive sea surface elevation spike that is not even remotely physical.
                                 microSWIFT_5 masked from index 19000 to end due to a large spike at the end.

Mission 20(Cleaned on 01/26/22): Adjusted end time from 2021-10-10T13:27:00 to 2021-10-10T13:18:15 since almost all microSWIFTs had made it to the beach at that point.
                                 Note that microSWIFTs 31 and 58 have bad gyros - may need to be Removed
                                 microSWIFT 26 must have rolled back down the beach past the spatial cutoff and needs to be masked from index 7000 to the end. 
                                 (11/13/22) Removed microSWIFTs 20, 18, and 16 due to nonphysical spikes in the data

Mission 21(Cleaned on 01/26/22):  Adjusted end time from 2021-10-10T14:36:00 to 2021-10-10T14:25:00
                                 Note that microSWIFT 58 has a bad gyro - may need to be Removed
                                 microSWIFT 7 is masked from index 10,000 to the end since there is weird-looking IMU data after this index
                                 microSWIFT 26 is masked from index 7000 to the end since the microSWIFT looks like it rolls back down the beach past the spatial cutoff.
                                 (11/13/22) Removed microSWIFTs 27 and 16 then masked 26 from index 6000 to end due to nonphysical signals

Mission 22(Cleaned on 01/26/22): Adjusted end time from 2021-10-10T15:27:00 to 2021-10-10T15:15:30 since all the microSWIFTs reached the beach before this point.
                                 Note that microSWIFT 58 has a bad gyro - may need to be Removed
                                 Note that microSWIFT 31 has a bad magnetometer since it has mostly flat readings
                                 microSWIFT 13 looks like it made it to the beach with flat IMU signals but is not masked by the spatial mask.
                                 (11/13/22) Removed microSWIFTs 49 and 16 due to non-physical signals

Mission 23(Cleaned on 01/26/22): Adjusted start time from 2021-10-10T16:05:30 to 2021-10-10T16:11:00 since most of the microSWIFTs haven't been deployed by this point which can be seen by the flay IMU signals.
                                 Adjusted end time from 2021-10-10T16:35:00 to 2021-10-10T16:21:00 since all of the microSWIFTs have reached the beach by this point.
				 Removed microSWIFT 58 since it has a bad gyro
                                 Removed microSWIFT 16 since it was missing GPS data
                                 (11/13/22) Removed microSWIFT 26 and masked microSWIFTs 40, 23, and 57 from start to index 500 due to large spikes at the beginning of the mission
                                 microSWIFT_46 masked from start to index 500 due to a large spike from deployment.

Mission 24(Cleaned on 01/26/22): Adjusted start time from 2021-10-11T13:05:00 to 2021-10-11T13:13:00 since most microSWIFTs haven't been deployed yet and we can see it in the flat signal.
                                 Adjusted end time from 2021-10-11T13:47:00 to 2021-10-11T13:30:00 since the microSWIFTs have all made it to the beach before this.
                                 Removed microSWIFT 12 since the IMU was not working and all signals were flat
                                 Removed microSWIFT 31 since it was missing a bunch of GPS data
                                 (11/14/22) Masked microSWIFT 37 and 36 from start to index 500 due to initial large spikes 
                                 microSWIFT_37 masked from the start to index 1000 due to a massive spike from deployment.
                                 microSWIFT_35 masked from index 4500 to end due to weird, flat, and non-physical sea-surface elevation

Mission 25(Cleaned on 01/26/22): Adjusted start time from 2021-10-11T14:10:00 to 2021-10-11T14:11:00 since many of the microSWIFTs hadn't been deployed yet as seen by flat signals from the IMU.
                                 Adjusted end time from 2021-10-11T14:50:00 to 2021-10-11T14:33:00 since almost all the microSWIFTs made it to the beach before this time so it is the time that the array is most coherent.

Mission 78(Cleaned on 02/15/22): Adjusted start time from 2021-10-29T14:28:00 to 2021-10-29T14:28:50 since a few of the microSWIFTs had not gotten into the water yet as seen by spikes in acceleration at the beginning of the record
                                 Adjusted the end time from 2021-10-29T14:47:00 to 2021-10-29T14:39:00 since most of the microSWIFTs had made it to the beach at this point
                                 Masked microSWIFT 42 from index 7000 to the end since a few points were not masked most likely due to it rolling back down the beach

                                 Adjusted end time from 2021-10-29T15:16:00 to 2021-10-29T15:11:30 since almost all of the microSWIFTs were on the beach at this point which we can see by the spatial mask cutting it off at this point
                                 Masked microSWIFT 18 from index 4000 to the end since some of the points were not fully cutoff by the spatial mask most likely due to the microSWIFT rolling back down the beach
                                 Masked microSWIFT 37 from index 4500 to the end since some of the points were not fully cutoff by the spatial mask most likely due to the microSWIFT rolling back down the beach
                                 Removed microSWIFT 43 since it had a bad z-axis gyroscope measurement seen by a completely flat signal
                                 Removed microSWIFT 16 since it had a suspicious gyroscope measurement which had large sweeping curves that look very unphysical
                                 Removed microSWIFT 58 since it has a bad gyroscope

Mission 80(Cleaned on 02/15/22): Adjusted the start time from 2021-10-29T15:24:00 to 2021-10-29T15:26:00 since most of the microSWIFTs were not in the water quite yet as seen by spikes in acceleration
                                 Adjusted the end time from 2021-10-29T15:40:00 to 2021-10-29T15:32:30 since most of the microSWIFTs had reached the beach at this point as seen by most of the data being cut off by the spatial mask at this point
                                 Removed microSWIFT 64 since it had almost no data ~500 points total during this mission

                                 Masked microSWIFT 12 from index 2200 to the end since it did not fully cut off all points from the spatial mask most likely due to the microSWIFT rolling back down the beach
                                 Masked microSWIFT 10 from index 4000 to the end since it did not fully cut off all points from the spatial mask most likely due to the microSWIFT rolling back down the beach
                                 Masked microSWIFT 60 from index 2500 to the end since it did not fully cut off all points from the spatial mask most likely due to the microSWIFT rolling back down the beach
                                 Masked microSWIFT 57 from index 4000 to the end since it did not fully cut off all points from the spatial mask most likely due to the microSWIFT rolling back down the beach

Mission 81(Cleaned on 02/15/22): Adjusted the end time from 2021-10-29T16:25:00 to 2021-10-29T16:16:30 since almost all of the microSWIFTs were on the beach at this point as seen by the cutoffs from the spatial mask
