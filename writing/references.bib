	abstract = {An analytical model is proposed for predicting the dynamics of instrumented oceanographic surface moorings made up of a combination of wire rope and compliant synthetic rope. The model simplifies the problem by treating only the vertical motion of the buoy and the longitudinal motion of the mooring line and attached instruments. It is demonstrated using full-scale experimental data and numerical simulations, that the simplified model captures all of the important dynamic effects and gives accurate predictions of the dynamic tension at the top of the mooring line. The model shows that the total mass and damping of the instruments and wire rope that make up the stiff upper half of the mooring are the major sources of the dynamic tension. Damping of the instruments becomes a significant factor in larger sea states, especially near the peak frequency of the wave spectrum. Elastic stretching of the wire and synthetic rope make up approximately 10\% of the total response. This is based on a coefficient of friction equal to 0.003 which fits the experimental data best.},

	abstract = {Presents an extended Kalman filter for real-time estimation of rigid body orientation using the newly developed MARG (magnetic, angular rate, and gravity) sensors. Each MARG sensor contains a three-axis magnetometer, a three-axis angular rate sensor, and a three-axis accelerometer. The filter represents rotations using quaternions rather than Euler angles, which eliminates the long-standing problem of singularities associated with attitude estimation. A process model for rigid body angular motions and angular rate measurements is defined. The process model converts angular rates into quaternion rates, which are integrated to obtain quaternions. The Gauss-Newton iteration algorithm is utilized to find the best quaternion that relates the measured accelerations and earth magnetic field in the body coordinate frame to calculated values in the earth coordinate frame. The best quaternion is used as part of the measurements for the Kalman filter. As a result of this approach, the measurement equations of the Kalman filter become linear, and the computational requirements are significantly reduced, making it possible to estimate orientation in real time. Extensive testing of the filter with synthetic data and actual sensor data proved it to be satisfactory. Test cases included the presence of large initial errors as well as high noise levels. In all cases the filter was able to converge and accurately track rotational motions.},

The wave evolution is well predicted by a numerical model based on the one-dimensional nonlinear shallow water equations with bore dissipation. The model is initialized with the time series of sea surface elevation and cross-shore current observed at the most offshore sensors (located about 50 to 120 m from the mean shoreline in mean water depths 0.80 to 2.10 m). The model accurately predicts the cross-shore variation of energy at both infragravity (nominally 0.004 {\textless} f {\textless} 0.05 Hz) and sea swell (here 0.05 {\textless} f ≤ 0.18 Hz) frequencies. In models of surf zone hydrodynamics, wave energy dissipation is frequently parameterized in terms of γs, the ratio of the sea swell significant wave height to the local mean water depth. The observed and predicted values of γs increase with increasing beach slope β and decreasing normalized (by a characteristic wavenumber k) water depth kh and are well correlated with β/kh, a measure of the fractional change in water depth over a wavelength. Errors in the predicted individual values of γs, are typically less than 20\%. It has been suggested that infragravity motions affect waves in the sea swell band and hence γs, but this speculation is difficult to test with field observations. Numerical simulations suggest that for the range of conditions considered here, γs is insensitive to infragravity energy levels.},

	abstract = {The aim of the present work is to develop a model able to represent the propagation and transformation of waves in nearshore areas. The focus is on the phenomena of wave breaking, shoaling and run-up. These different phenomena are represented through a hybrid approach obtained by the coupling of non-linear Shallow Water equations with the extended Boussinesq equations of Madsen and Sorensen. The novelty is the switch tool between the two modelling equations: a critical free surface Froude criterion. This is based on a physically meaningful new approach to detect wave breaking, which corresponds to the steepening of the wave's crest which turns into a roller. To allow for an appropriate discretization of both types of equations, we consider a finite element Upwind Petrov Galerkin method with a novel limiting strategy, that guarantees the preservation of smooth waves as well as the monotonicity of the results in presence of discontinuities. We provide a detailed discussion of the implementation of the newly proposed detection method, as well as of two other well known criteria which are used for comparison. An extensive benchmarking on several problems involving different wave phenomena and breaking conditions allows to show the robustness of the numerical method proposed, as well as to assess the advantages and limitations of the different detection methods.},

	abstract = {Since time immemorial, surface water waves and their subsequent breaking have been studied. Herein we concentrate on breaking surface waves in deep and intermediate water depths. Progress has been made in several areas, including the prediction of their geometry, breaking onset, and especially energy dissipation. Recent progress in the study of geometric properties has evolved such that we can identify possible connections between crest geometry and energy dissipation and its rate. Onset prediction based on the local wave-energy growth rate appears robust, consistent with experiments, although the application of criteria in phase-resolving, deterministic prediction may be limited as calculation of the diagnostic parameter is nontrivial. Parameterization of the dissipation rate has benefited greatly from synergistic field and laboratory investigations, and relationships among the dynamics, kinematics, and the parameterization of the dynamics using geometric properties are now available. Field efforts continue, and although progress has been made, consensus among researchers is limited, in part because of the relatively few studies. Although direct numerical simulations of breaking waves are not yet a viable option, simpler models (e.g., implementation of an eddy viscosity model) have yielded positive results, particularly with regard to energy dissipation.},

Breaking waves are identified using images collected with cameras onboard the buoys, and the breaking activity is well-correlated with wave steepness. Vertical shear in the currents produces a frequency-dependent effective current that modifies the linear dispersion relation. Accounting for these sheared currents in the wavenumber spectrum is essential in calculating the correct wave steepness; without this, wave steepness can be over (under) estimated on opposing (following) currents by up to 20\%. The observed bulk steepness values suggest a limiting value of 0.4. The observed fraction of breaking waves is in good agreement with several existing models, each based on wave steepness. Further, a semispectral model designed for all depth regimes also compares favorably with measured breaking fractions. In this model, the majority of wave breaking is predicted to occur in the higher frequency bands (i.e., short waves). There is a residual dependence on directional spreading, in which wave breaking decreases with increasing directional spread.},

The velocity profiles are obtained from a pulse-coherent acoustic Doppler sonar on a wave-following platform, termed a Surface Wave Instrument Float with Tracking (SWIFT), and the dissipation rates are estimated from the structure function of the velocity profiles. The purpose of the SWIFT is to maintain a constant range to the time-varying surface and thereby observe the turbulence in breaking crests (i.e., above the mean still water level). The Lagrangian quality is also useful to prefilter wave orbital motions and mean currents from the velocity measurements, which are limited in magnitude by phase wrapping in the coherent Doppler processing. Field testing and examples from both offshore whitecaps and nearshore surf breaking are presented. Dissipation rates are elevated (up to 10$^{\textrm{−3}}$ m$^{\textrm{2}}$ s$^{\textrm{−3}}$) during strong breaking conditions, which are confirmed using surface videos recorded on board SWIFT. Although some velocity contamination is present from platform tilting and heaving, the structure of the velocity profiles is dominated by a turbulent cascade of eddies (i.e., the inertial subrange). The noise, or uncertainty, in the dissipation estimates is shown to be normally distributed and uncorrelated with platform motion. Aggregated SWIFT measurements are shown to be useful in mapping wave-breaking dissipation in space and time.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/section{\textgreater}},

Here, the shape and evolution of plunging breakers is analyzed quantitatively using three-dimensional scans of the water surface collected at high spatial and temporal resolution with a multi-beam terrestrial lidar scanner. The observed internal void shapes in plunging breakers agree well with previously developed theoretical shapes at the onset of breaking, and become more elongated and less steep as breaking progresses.

	abstract = {To investigate the dynamics of flows near nonuniform bathymetry, single channels (on average 30 m wide and 1.5 m deep) were dredged across the surf zone at five different times, and the subsequent evolution of currents and morphology was observed for a range of wave and tidal conditions. In addition, circulation was simulated with the numerical modeling system COAWST, initialized with the observed incident waves and channel bathymetry, and with an extended set of wave conditions and channel geometries. The simulated flows are consistent with alongshore flows and rip-current circulation patterns observed in the surf zone. Near the offshore-directed flows that develop in the channel, the dominant terms in modeled momentum balances are wave-breaking accelerations, pressure gradients, advection, and the vortex force. The balances vary spatially, and are sensitive to wave conditions and the channel geometry. The observed and modeled maximum offshore-directed flow speeds are correlated with a parameter based on the alongshore gradient in breaking-wave-driven-setup across the nonuniform bathymetry (a function of wave height and angle, water depths in the channel and on the sandbar, and a breaking threshold) and the breaking-wave-driven alongshore flow speed. The offshore-directed flow speed increases with dissipation on the bar and reaches a maximum (when the surf zone is saturated) set by the vertical scale of the bathymetric variability.},

	abstract = {Depth-induced wave breaking is the primary dissipation mechanism for ocean surface waves in shallow waters. Different parametrizations were developed for parameterizing depth-induced wave breaking process in ocean surface wave models. The performance of six commonly-used parameterizations in simulating significant wave heights (SWHs) is assessed in this study. The main differences between these six parameterizations are representations of the breaker index and the fraction of breaking waves. Laboratory and field observations consisting of 882 cases from 14 sources of published observational data are used in the assessment. We demonstrate that the six parameterizations have reasonable performance in parameterizing depth-induced wave breaking in shallow waters, but with their own limitations and drawbacks. The widely-used parameterization suggested by Battjes and Janssen (1978, BJ78) has a drawback of underpredicting the SWHs in the locally-generated wave conditions and overpredicting in the remotely-generated wave conditions over flat bottoms. The drawback of BJ78 was addressed by a parameterization suggested by Salmon et al. (2015, SA15). But SA15 had relatively larger errors in SWHs over sloping bottoms than BJ78. We follow SA15 and propose a new parameterization with a dependence of the breaker index on the normalized water depth in deep waters similar to SA15. In shallow waters, the breaker index of the new parameterization has a nonlinear dependence on the local bottom slope rather than the linear dependence used in SA15. Overall, this new parameterization has the best performance with an average scatter index of ∼8.2\% in comparison with the three best performing existing parameterizations with the average scatter index between 9.2\% and 13.6\%.},

This study evaluates the Lagrangian vertical and horizontal motions of a particle at the surface in a natural, random sea state using second-order, finite-depth wave theory. In deep water, the predicted low-frequency (infragravity) surface height fluctuations are much larger than Eulerian bound wave motions and of the opposite sign. Comparison to surface elevation bispectra observed with a moored buoy in steady, high-wind conditions shows good agreement and confirms that—in contrast to the Eulerian sea surface motion with predominant phase coupling between the spectral peak and double-frequency harmonic components—nonlinearity in Lagrangian wave observations is dominated by phase-coupled infragravity motions. Sea surface skewness estimates obtained from moored buoys in deep and shallow sites, over a wide range of wind–sea and swell conditions, are in good agreement with second-order theory predictions.

It combines wave breaking basic physical quantities, namely, the breaking probability and the dissipation rate per unit area. The energy lost by waves is first explicitly calculated in physical space before being distributed over the relevant spectral components. The transition from deep to shallow water is made possible by using a dissipation rate per unit area of breaking waves that varies with the wave height, wavelength and water depth. This parameterization is implemented in the WAVEWATCH III modeling framework, which is applied to a wide range of conditions and scales, from the global ocean to the beach scale. Wave height, peak and mean periods, and spectral data are validated using in situ and remote sensing data. Model errors are comparable to those of other specialized deep or shallow water parameterizations.

The spectral breaking term is incorporated in a set of coupled evolution equations for complex Fourier amplitudes, based on ideal-fluid Boussinesq equations for wave motion. The model is used to predict the surface elevations from given complex Fourier amplitudes obtained from measured time records in laboratory experiments at the upwave boundary. The model is also used, together with the assumption of random, independent initial phases, to calculate the evolution of the energy spectrum of random waves.

	abstract = {This is the second of a two-part series concerning remote observation and wave-by-wave analysis of the onset of breaking for spilling and plunging waves in the surf zone. Nearshore phase-averaged and phase-resolving wave models parameterize and directly simulate wave breaking and require realistic critical values of key wave parameters, such as the depth-limited breaking index γ, steepness, or phase speed to initialize wave breaking. Using LIDAR line-scans and infrared imagery, we observe over 1,600 breaking waves at the US Army Corps of Engineers Field Research Facility (FRF) in Duck, NC, and examine these parameters on a wave-by-wave basis at the onset of breaking for 413 spilling and 111 plunging waves. We find that γ is maximum near the onset of breaking at values consistent with those previously observed at the FRF, but that γ for plunging waves (0.73 ≤ γP ≤ 0.81) is greater than γ for spilling waves (0.63 ≤ γS ≤ 0.71). Direct estimates of wave face slope are maximum at the onset of breaking, approximately 22° for spilling and 30° for plunging waves. Using the relationship between γ and wave face slope, we develop a threshold for the onset of breaking that is a linear function of the two parameters. Wave face slope and γ are further used together to quantify whether a spilling- or plunging-type breaker is more likely. We test the Miche steepness limit on our depth-limited breaking data and find it correctly predicts only 10\% of the plunging breakers and none of the spilling breakers in the surf zone.},

Although time series measurements on a stationary vessel are thought to be accurate, an underway vessel introduces a Doppler shift to the observed wave spectrum. This Doppler shift is a function of the wavenumber vector and the velocity vector of the vessel. Of all the possible relative angles between wave direction and vessel heading, there are two main scenarios: 1) vessel steaming into waves and 2) vessel steaming with waves. Previous studies have considered only a subset of cases, and all were in scenario 1. This was likely to avoid ambiguities, which arise when the vessel is steaming with waves. This study addresses the ambiguities and analyzes arbitrary cases. In addition, a practical method is provided that is useful in situations when the vessel is changing speed or heading. These methods improved the laser rangefinder estimates of spectral shapes and peak parameters when compared to nearby buoys and a spectral wave model.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/section{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {This is the first of a 2-part series concerning remote observation and wave-by-wave analysis of the onset of breaking in the surf zone. In the surf zone, breaking waves drive nearshore circulation, suspend sediment, and promote air-sea gas exchange. Nearshore wave model predictions often diverge from in situ measurements near the break point location because common parameterizations do not account for the rapid changes that occur near the onset of breaking. This work presents extensive methodology to combine data from a line-scanning LIDAR and thermal infrared cameras to detect breaking, classify breaker type, and measure geometric wave parameters on a wave-by-wave basis, which can be used to improve breaker parameterizations. Over 2,600 non-breaking and 1,600 breaking waves are analyzed from data collected at the USACE Field Research Facility in Duck, NC, including 413 spilling and 111 plunging waves for which the onset of breaking was observed. Wave height is estimated using a spatio-temporal method for wave tracking that preserves the sea surface elevation maximum and overcomes field of view limitations. Methods for estimating instantaneous wave speed are refined by fitting a skewed Gaussian function to each wave profile before tracking the peaks. Wave slope is estimated from a linear fit to the upper 80\% of the wave face, which provides a robust metric and strong correlation with geometric wave slope defined relative to mean sea level. Finally, breaking wave face foam coverage is analyzed to assess common model assumptions about roller length for wave energy dissipation parameterizations.},

	abstract = {Surface wave instrumentation ﬂoats with tracking were deployed by helicopter ahead of ﬁve large storms off the Oregon coast. The buoys drifted freely with the wave motions, surface currents, and wind. The buoys use a 9-DoF inertial measurement unit that fuses the measurements of accelerometers, magnetometers, and gyroscopes to measure acceleration in the global NorthWest-Up reference frame. Rapid sampling (25 Hz) allows for the observation of both propagating wave motions and wave breaking events. Bulk wave parameters and wave spectra are calculated from the motion of the buoys using conventional methods, and breaking wave impacts are identiﬁed in the raw acceleration data using a new algorithm based on a short-time Fourier transform. The number of breaking waves is used to infer breaker fraction, which is found to depend on bulk wave steepness as previously shown in the literature. The magnitude and duration of acceleration during breaking is used in a new quantiﬁcation of breaker intensity, which increases with wave height, period, and steepness. There is signiﬁcant variance of breaker intensity in a given wave ﬁeld, such that intense breakers still occur in relatively mild wave ﬁelds. The buoy observations are compared to the output of the WaveWatch III forecast model, with evaluation of an empirical breaker prediction scheme applied to WaveWatch III output.},

Near the break point, where the wave height is greater than predicted by first-order wave theory, the measured ‘set-down’ was consistently less than theory would predict from the deep water wave height. Inside the break point the bore height was found to be a linear function of the mean water depth. In this region, the gradient of the set-up, , was related to the beach slope tan β and the mean ratio of wave height to water depth by the equation .},

The breaking will occur once the wave reaches the Stokes limiting steepness. The breaking probability and the location of breaking onset can be predicted, properties of incipient breakers measured.

We show that the Barthelemy et al. (2018) breaking onset criterion, which they validated for deep and intermediate water depths, also segregates breaking crests from nonbreaking crests in shallow water, with subsequent breaking always following the exceedance of their proposed generic breaking threshold. We consider a number of representative wave types, including regular, irregular, solitary, and focused waves, shoaling over idealized bed topographies including an idealized bar geometry and a mildly to steeply sloping planar beach. Our results show that the new breaking onset criterion is capable of detecting single and multiple breaking events in time and space in arbitrary water depth. Further, we show that the new generic criterion provides improved skill for signaling imminent breaking onset, relative to the available kinematic or geometric breaking onset criteria in the literature. In particular, the new criterion is suitable for use in wave-resolving models that cannot intrinsically detect the onset of wave breaking.},
